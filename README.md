## Intro To Node



A __node_module__ is a Lego block of code. Everything in a node app is modular, meaning it is made up of many different, smaller parts that work toward the end functionality.

__NPM__ stands for Node Package Manager. It's a tool that allows us to easily access the node module ecosystem and add them to our project.

Every node app has a __package.json__, which is the master file that keeps track of all node modules your project cares about.

To add a 'package.json' to you project, run the command 'npm init', and accept all defaults.
